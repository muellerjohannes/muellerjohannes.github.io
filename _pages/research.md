My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular, this includes the following topics:
* Geometry of Markov decision processes
* Representational capacity of neural networks
* Connections between neural networks and differential equations

**Geometry of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes**
Markov decision processes 

**Geometry of Natural Policy Gradient Methods**

**Energy Natural Gradients for Physics Informed Neural Networks**
Neural network-based PDE solvers receive quickly growing attention within the scientific machine learning and applied mathematics communities. 
One of the most popular approaches is the one of *Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)* or *Deep Galerkin Method* which relies on minimizing the residual of the PDE.
For example, for the Poisson equation 

$$ -\Delta u = f \quad \text{in } \Omega $$

\begin{align}
  -\Delta u = f \quad \text{in } \Omega
\end{align}

as a prototypical PDE
