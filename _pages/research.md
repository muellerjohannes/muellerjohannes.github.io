My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular, this includes the following topics:
* Geometry of Markov decision processes
* Representational capacity of neural networks
* Connections between neural networks and differential equations

**Geometry of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes**
Markov decision processes 

**Geometry of Natural Policy Gradient Methods**

**Energy Natural Gradients for Physics Informed Neural Networks**
Neural network-based PDE solvers receive quickly growing attention within the scientific machine learning and applied mathematics communities. 
One of the most popular approaches is the one of *Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)* or *Deep Galerkin Method* which relies on minimizing the residual of the PDE.
For example, for the Poisson equation 

$$ -\Delta u = f \quad \text{in } \Omega $$

$$\begin{aligned} 2x - 4 &= 6 \\ 2x &= 10 \\ x &= 5 \end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{align}
\sqrt{37} & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2-1}{12^2}} \\
 & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2}{12^2}\cdot\frac{73^2-1}{73^2}} \\ 
 & = \sqrt{\frac{73^2}{12^2}}\sqrt{\frac{73^2-1}{73^2}} \\
 & = \frac{73}{12}\sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{73^2}} \\ 
 & \approx \frac{73}{12}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2\cdot73^2}\right)
\end{align}$$

as a prototypical PDE
