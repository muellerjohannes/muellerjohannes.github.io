My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. In particular this includes the following topics:
* Geometry of Markov decision processes
* Representational capacity of neural networks
* Connections between neural networks and differential equations

**Geometry of (Partially Observable) Markov Decision Processes**

**Energy Natural Gradients for Physics Informed Neural Networks**
