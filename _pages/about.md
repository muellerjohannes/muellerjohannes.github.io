I have recently submitted my PhD thesis under the name [*Geometry of Optimization in Markov Decision Processes and Neural Network Based PDE Solvers*](master/files/thesis-jm.pdf) at the University of Leipzig.
Since then I have joined Junior Professorship for Mathematics of Machine Learning, RWTH Aachen University held by [Semih Çaycı](https://www.mathc.rwth-aachen.de/~cayci/home/). 
Before that, I was a PhD student at the [International Max Planck Research School "Mathematics in the Sciences" ](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig where I was jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay]([https://www.mis.mpg.de/ay/homepages/nay/](https://www.dsf.tuhh.de/index.php/team/nihatay/)) and [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/).
Prior, I received a master's and bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg as well as a Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Mathematics from the  University of Warwick. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. For my PhD project, I studied the geometry of state-action distributions of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which lead to connections to the fields of Algebraic Statistics and Information Geometry. Further interests include the theoretical analysis of neural network based approaches to the numerical solution of PDEs.
