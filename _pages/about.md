I am a third year PhD student in mathematics at the [IMPRS MiS](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig where I am jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay](https://www.mis.mpg.de/ay/homepages/nay/) and [Guido Mont&uacute;far](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. For my PhD project I study the geometry of state-action distributions of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which lead to connections to the fields of Algebraic Statistics and Information Geometry. Further interest include the theoretical analysis of neural network based approaches to the numerical solution of PDEs. Before starting my PhD I received a Masters and Bachelors degree in Mathematics from the University of Freiburg as well as a Masters degree in Interdisciplinary Mathematics from the  University of Warwick. 

Apart from my academic life I enjoy different outdoor activities like road cycling, ski touring and bouldering and try to explore the huge world of photography.
