I recently submitted my PhD thesis with the title [*Geometry of Optimization in Markov Decision Processes and Neural Network Based PDE Solvers*](../files/thesis-jm.pdf) at the University of Leipzig and have joined the Junior Professorship for Mathematics of Machine Learning, RWTH Aachen University held by [Semih Çaycı](https://www.mathc.rwth-aachen.de/~cayci/home/). Before that, I was a PhD student at the [International Max Planck Research School *Mathematics in the Sciences*](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig where I was jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay](https://www.dsf.tuhh.de/index.php/team/nihatay/) and [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/).
Prior, I studied Mathematics at the University of Freiburg and the University of Warwick. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics. For my PhD project, I studied the geometry of state-action distributions of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which lead to connections to the fields of Algebraic Statistics and Information Geometry. Further interests include the theoretical analysis of neural network based approaches to the numerical solution of PDEs.
