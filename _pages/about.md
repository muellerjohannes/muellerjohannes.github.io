I am a PostDoc at the Institute of Mathematics at TU Berlin in the group of [*Benjamin Gess*](https://www.bgess.de/). My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and applied mathematics with a particular focus on the Reinforcement Learning and neural network based PDE solvers. 


Prior, I was a Postdoc at the Junior Professorship for Mathematics of Machine Learning, RWTH Aachen University held by [Semih Çaycı](https://www.mathc.rwth-aachen.de/~cayci/home/) and a PhD student at the [International Max Planck Research School *Mathematics in the Sciences*](https://www.imprs-mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig where I was jointly supervised by [Nihat Ay](https://www.dsf.tuhh.de/index.php/team/nihatay/) and [Guido Montúfar](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~montufar/).
